# challenge-2-portfolio
This portfolio showcases both the use of semantic HTML elements in addition to CSS styling.

Flexbox and media queries afforded a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile use.  In particular for the "Previous Work" section, which dynamically changes the size of elements and rearranges them based on the device's current horizontal resolution. Flexbox was also applied to other elements such as the navigation menu and the contact section for an improved mobile experience.

Notably, pseudoelements were utilized  in order to offer a more visually interesting and responsive website with certain elements such as the portfolio pieces, which are intially blurred out, but then deblur when a mouse cursor is placed over them.
